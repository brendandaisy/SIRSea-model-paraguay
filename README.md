# SIRSea

A deterministic, discrete-time SIRS model with time-varying transmission rate. 
Transmission rate is a combination of seasonal patterns for repeating yearly changes in transmissibility, and 
non-repeating patterns which model shifts in transmission every K weeks (similar to a Bayesian B-spline)
